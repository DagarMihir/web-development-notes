			<h2>Want to hear one of best rock songs of all time?</h2>

			<p>
				This song is "Paradise City" by one of the best rock bands of all time "Guns n' Roses". The first time I heard it, was through a video game called "Burnout Paradise". The song hasn't left my brain since and will not leave till I leave..
